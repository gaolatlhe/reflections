What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. so that you can track commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
A. Staging area temporarily holds files that are about to be commit. I think its
just for grouping files :)

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
A. By only putting one change at a time in the staging area
